                            EE 271 is "Digital Circuits and Systems" at the University of Washington. The class covers logic gates and digital design, and has weekly labs to expose students to FPGAs and digital design in practice. For our final lab, we were given a choice of projects to build---I chose "Frogger." The game was designed for the Altera DE1 FPGA development board. Utilizing SystemVerilog and ModelSim to build and test my code, I created an interactive game where the user must get their green light to the end of the board without hitting the moving red cars on the light display. The user moves by using the buttons on the De1, the "player screen" is displayed using a 16x16 Bi-Color LED Array Board-segment display, and the outcome of the game was shown on the 7-segment display.

                            Utilizing Arduino Uno, group-designed PCB, 3D Printed Chassis, and soldering, I worked in a group of four to create a line-following robot. We used Fusion360 and PrusaSlice to design and print the chassis and casing for our robot. We used KiCad to design and personalize our PCB board, and an Arduino Uno to program movement. Using a basic understanding of photoresistors and tracking abilities, we applied basic circuitry and hardware skills to create a robot that completed a line course, placing within the top 13 of the entire course.

                            As a passion project for a Summer program, I designed a wearable "Third Eye for the Blind". This device is worn on the hand and utilizes ultrasonic sensors to determine proximity of nearby objects as well as a thermistor to sense the temperature of nearby objects. Using a vibrating motor and a buzzer, the user is given physical and audible cues on their surroundings to help them better navigate their surroundings.

These adapted toys are distributed locally and nationally to support children with disabilities. In 2024â€“2025, I served as the Junior Toy Adaptation Chair, leading weekly meetings to repair broken adapted toys and ensure donation quality. In 2025â€“2026, I transitioned into the Toy Donation Chair role, where I coordinate with local clinics and schools to deliver adapted toys and strengthen community partnerships.<p>
